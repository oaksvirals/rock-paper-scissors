# rock-paper-scissors

This is a wizardy twist on the classic game of rock, paper, scissors.

The player selects from three different spells to combat the enemy wizard. Game is complete with basic animations.

In this project I learned:
- DOM manipulation
- more about using functions
- query selectors
- making acute changes to specific parts of the html
- game logic
