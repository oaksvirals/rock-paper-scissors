# rock-paper-scissors

Currently: A JavaScript Console Game

Running this game in your browser with the dev tools console open allows you to play a 5 round game of rock, paper, scissors.

For this project I used the following JS:
- multiple functions
- tenary operators
- Math.random()
- prompted for user input
- if, else if, else statements
- for loops
- score keeping with a switch statement
